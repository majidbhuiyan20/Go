1. What is a Goroutine?
A goroutine is a lightweight thread of execution in Go that allows a program to run
 multiple functions concurrently.

 =>A goroutine is a small background task managed by Go.

2. Why Goroutine is Needed?

To run multiple tasks at the same time
To make programs faster and more efficient
To handle many users/requests simultaneously
To simplify concurrent programming

3. Characteristics of Goroutine

Very lightweight (uses small memory)
Created and managed by Go runtime
Faster than OS threads
Thousands or millions can run together
Runs independently of other goroutines

4. What is a Kernel?

The kernel is the core (heart) of an operating system.
👉 It is the first program that starts when a computer is turned on
👉 It controls everything in the system
The kernel is a manager that connects software (programs) with hardware (CPU, memory, disk).
